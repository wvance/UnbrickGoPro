It is the Linux kernel (a modified 2.6.38.8) that GoPro released on their website.

Apply the included kernel patches and use the included kernel config file.
I used the toolchain that GoPro posted for building the kernel, but I am sure others will work.

The busybox here is an unmodified busybox 1.21.0, available from http://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.21.0.tar.bz2
My busybox config file is also included here.
